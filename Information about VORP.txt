Here are the current problems we need to figure out (in no particular order):

1. How to parse both .csv baseball files correctly. While actually parsing the info may be easy enough, we have to deal with
    the fact that the number of players in both files are vastly different (428 vs 867).
2. Determine an algorithm that will always get the right answer. This is a variation of the Knapsack problem (knapsack size is
    replaced with money, items replaced with players, item weights replaced with salaries, and item values replaced with VORPs).
    It'll be lots of fun to solve this dynamic programming problem. Here's a powerpoint regarding the problem that may/may not
    help. https://drive.google.com/a/lions.molloy.edu/file/d/0B5DGvLP6lAUtVWNJeC1aYXhuUDg/view?usp=sharing

Here is a pastebin that contains the information from both websites. http://pastebin.com/fj4XBqPr
Hint: Copying directly from the Raw Paste Data at the bottom is easier.
